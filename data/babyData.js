var babyData = {
    1: "It's only been a week, but already your newborn knows {subject_pronoun} can rely on you. By now, {subject_pronoun} can recognize your voice. Hearing {object_pronoun} parents' familiar voices helps {object_pronoun_2} adjust to the strange new world outside the womb and lets {object_pronoun_2} know that {subject_pronoun}'s not alone. So the more you talk to {object_pronoun_2}, the better. {subject_pronoun} can't understand your words, but your love comes through loud and clear.",
    2: "This week, your baby can focus on objects 8 to 14 inches away -- just about the distance between {object_pronoun} eyes and yours during feedings. In fact, babies this age prefer faces to other objects. By looking at {object_pronoun_2} during {object_pronoun} meals, you'll encourage {object_pronoun_2} to practice focusing. As you feed {object_pronoun_2}, move your head slowly from side to side and see if {object_pronoun} eyes follow you. This helps build {object_pronoun} eye muscles and tracking skills.",
    3: "Though {object_pronoun} movements are still random and jerky, your baby can control {object_pronoun} body in one amazing way by this week. {subject_pronoun} can snuggle! As you hold {object_pronoun_2}, watch how {subject_pronoun} adjusts {object_pronoun} posture towards you. {subject_pronoun} finds your arms and even your scent calming and comforting. There couldn't be a more perfect and relaxing way for the two of you to bond.",
    4: "Have you noticed your baby using {object_pronoun} vocal chords in ways other than crying? {subject_pronoun} may coo and make \"ahh\" sounds this week, especially when {subject_pronoun} sees mom or dad. Babies learn by mimicking -- so replay {object_pronoun} sounds back to {object_pronoun_2}. {subject_pronoun} not only loves the attention, but {subject_pronoun}'s also finding out that {object_pronoun} voice has power: {subject_pronoun} calls, you appear!",
    5: "This week, your baby's movements are becoming smoother and more purposeful--those random, jerky motions are beginning to disappear. {subject_pronoun}'s not ready for gym class, but try to give {object_pronoun_2} time each day for using {object_pronoun} body. You can give {object_pronoun_2} a gentle mini-workout by slowly pulling {object_pronoun} to a sitting position, or letting {object_pronoun_2} \"fly\" by resting {object_pronoun} tummy-down on your forearm. Always support {object_pronoun} head.",
    6: "It wasn't gas! At about this age, your baby will flash an adorable gummy grin that is {object_pronoun} first genuine smile. How can you tell? {object_pronoun} eyes will brighten and widen as {subject_pronoun} moves {object_pronoun} mouth upwards. By smiling back and cooing to {object_pronoun_2}, you'll do more than get another smile. You're teaching {object_pronoun_2} that {object_pronoun} actions cause a reaction--with pleasant results!",
    7: "Your baby is busy this week. {subject_pronoun}'s starting to make sense of {object_pronoun} senses -- {subject_pronoun} can look at a rattle and connect it to the sound it makes. {subject_pronoun}'s also developing more sophisticated tastes in color, too, preferring bright colors and three dimensional objects over flat black and white ones. A musical mobile in {object_pronoun} crib could entertain {object_pronoun_2} for several minutes -- just watch {object_pronoun_2} follow it and smile!",
    8: "{object_pronoun} head is still wobbly, but those neck muscles get stronger by the day. Around this age, your baby can lift {object_pronoun} head about 45 degrees. Put {object_pronoun_2} on {object_pronoun} stomach for brief periods every day so {subject_pronoun} can practice. {subject_pronoun} may even try to do mini-pushups! Encourage {object_pronoun_2} to look up by placing a mirror or dangling a toy in front of {object_pronoun_2}.",
    9: "Your baby's world is alive with the sound of music this week. Sounds fascinate {object_pronoun_2}, especially high tones and pitches. {subject_pronoun}'s also interested in hearing you talk, and will stare intently at your mouth as you speak to {object_pronoun_2}. {subject_pronoun} may even reply with cooing or \"goo\"-ing. Though {subject_pronoun}'s not ready for epic poems, start reading to {object_pronoun_2} -- {subject_pronoun}'s already building a bank of vocabulary words.",
    10: "Guess what? Your baby can pick out {object_pronoun} parents' faces in a group. {object_pronoun} eyes widen and shine and {subject_pronoun} wiggles with glee when someone familiar comes near. {subject_pronoun}'s ready and willing to hone {object_pronoun} social skills, so make {object_pronoun_2} part of family activities. Bring {object_pronoun_2} to the table during dinner, or put {object_pronoun_2} in a carrier sling while you work. {subject_pronoun} loves your company as much as you love {object_pronoun}.",
    11: "At this age, your baby is sleeping less, and {subject_pronoun}'s awake for longer periods of the day. {subject_pronoun}'s anxious to learn about {object_pronoun} world and family, and {subject_pronoun} may not always be interested in your choice of game. If {subject_pronoun} turns {object_pronoun} head and looks away, {subject_pronoun}'s declaring {subject_pronoun}'s ready to move on to something else. At only 11 weeks, {subject_pronoun}'s got ideas of {object_pronoun} own!",
    12: "Around this age, your baby has discovered an endless source of enchantment--his hands. {subject_pronoun}'s realized that those fingers and thumbs are separate objects. {subject_pronoun} can also bring {object_pronoun} hands together, look at them, then put them to {object_pronoun} mouth to taste. Let {object_pronoun_2} experiment with these wonderful tools by offering different textures for {object_pronoun_2} to feel--a velvet scarf or a rubbery toy. Just make sure it's clean!",
    13: "All of those sleepless nights are really starting to pay off now. Besides bestowing sweet smiles and coos on you, your baby may be laughing, chuckling and babbling in long chains. Because you've been talking to {object_pronoun_2}, {subject_pronoun}'s starting to figure out that your message is broken into parts--syllables. Soon {subject_pronoun}'ll start using these syllables by putting together vowel sounds with consonants.",
    14: "Rattles and dangling toys on a bouncy seat do more than amuse your baby at 14 weeks. These doodads help {object_pronoun} hand and eye skills develop together. Vary {object_pronoun} diet of toys -- {subject_pronoun}'s intrigued with multi-textured toys, bright primary colors, and things that make sounds. {subject_pronoun}'ll bat or grasp them ({subject_pronoun}'ll also try to mouth them, {object_pronoun} favorite way of learning!).",
    15: "Say good-bye to a relatively stationary baby. Around now, your baby may start rolling over--either from {object_pronoun} back to {object_pronoun} front, or front to back. This is quite an accomplishment! In the coming weeks, {subject_pronoun}'ll likely master {object_pronoun} rolls in one direction. Make sure {subject_pronoun}'s never left alone on a bed or high surface. And give {object_pronoun_2} lots of praise for each flip -- {subject_pronoun}'ll relish the attention and will be inspired to keep at it.",
    16: "Your four-month-old is getting stronger by the day. {subject_pronoun} may protest when {subject_pronoun}'s placed on {object_pronoun} stomach, but {subject_pronoun} needs tummy time every day for exercising {object_pronoun} neck, chest, rib cage and arm muscles. These muscle groups are necessary for rolling over, sitting up, and crawling. Join {object_pronoun_2} on the floor and talk outside of {object_pronoun} range of vision. {subject_pronoun}'ll be distracted from fussing for a few minutes while {subject_pronoun}'s busy looking for you!",
    17: "Your baby probably entertains everyone (including {object_pronoun_2}self) by making razzing noises or blowing raspberries. {subject_pronoun}'ll laugh when you tickle {object_pronoun} belly, {subject_pronoun}'ll mimic your words by making similar sounds. Boost both {object_pronoun} ego and speech skills by chatting and making eye contact with {object_pronoun_2} whenever possible, for example during playtime or while changing a diaper. {subject_pronoun}'s a lot more responsive now, and there's nothing more exciting to {object_pronoun_2} than your face and voice.",
    18: "It's awfully quiet in that crib. You may have been pleasantly surprised to find that your baby has been peacefully playing by herself for the past 10 to 15 minutes. {object_pronoun} eyesight is sharp now and {object_pronoun} depth perception is also improving. {subject_pronoun}'s very busy using {object_pronoun} eyes and hands in play to learn about {object_pronoun_2}self. Think about rotating {object_pronoun} toys every so often -- {subject_pronoun} doesn't need more than a few at a time.",
    19: "Your baby's dad claims that he distinctly heard \"daa daa.\" But, at 19 weeks, your baby doesn't mean anything by those sounds-{subject_pronoun}'s simply putting consonants together with vowels. You can help {object_pronoun_2} connect sounds with meanings by labeling things: point to pictures in {object_pronoun} books, touch {object_pronoun} eyes, nose and mouth while naming them. Before long, {subject_pronoun}'ll be calling you both by name!",
    20: "What a long way your baby has come since {subject_pronoun} was born! By now, {subject_pronoun} knows exactly who you are--and is even starting to know {object_pronoun_2}self. {subject_pronoun} smiles when seeing {object_pronoun} reflection in a mirror and is beginning to display some distinct personality traits--is {subject_pronoun} quiet or a nonstop babbler? By watching {object_pronoun} face, you'll probably be able to detect how {subject_pronoun} expresses different emotions, too.",
    21: "Your baby is on the go at this age. {subject_pronoun} likes to move. {subject_pronoun} may creep around the floor and turn {object_pronoun} direction to get a new view. In fact, {subject_pronoun} might be too busy to play with you. Honor {object_pronoun} need for space. Put {object_pronoun_2} on the floor or in a playyard and let {object_pronoun_2} entertain {object_pronoun_2}self. Keep your eye on {object_pronoun_2}, but enjoy a few minutes of free time!",
    22: "Is there a budding scientist in your midst? This week, your baby's favorite mode for performing experiments is putting whatever {subject_pronoun} can into {object_pronoun} mouth. {subject_pronoun}'s also conducting some new tests: dropping {object_pronoun} toys to the ground and comparing the different sounds they make when they land. Other ways to help sharpen {object_pronoun} auditory skills: point out a plane flying overhead, or an ambulance speeding down the street.",
    23: "Babies develop muscle coordination and strength from the head down. By 23 weeks, {subject_pronoun}'s acquired control and strength in {object_pronoun} upper body--a long way from when {subject_pronoun} was first born! But now {object_pronoun} legs and torso are ready for a challenge. Some ways to help {object_pronoun} progress: gently pull {object_pronoun_2} to a standing position on your lap and bounce, or pull {object_pronoun_2} to a sitting position-froggy-style--on the floor.",
    24: "Your baby is already storing memories this week. {subject_pronoun} recognizes names, basic words like \"no,\" and \"bye-bye,\" and familiar sounds. {subject_pronoun} looks when you point out objects and {subject_pronoun} may also point at things when you name them. Called receptive language, this precedes {object_pronoun} ability to speak. Since {subject_pronoun} remembers daily rituals, try greeting {object_pronoun_2} each morning with the same phrase. {subject_pronoun}'ll look forward to it.",
    25: "Some of a baby's big achievements--sitting, crawling, walking--occur at vastly different rates over the next several months. Your baby may be more steady and better at sitting up on {object_pronoun} own, but {subject_pronoun} might still need help. Prop {object_pronoun_2} up with a few pillows to cushion any falls. Then place tempting objects in front and to the side of {object_pronoun_2}.",
    26: "Your baby is halfway through this incredible first year! {subject_pronoun}'s still a charmer, but {subject_pronoun} may be more selective about giving out smiles to strangers. {subject_pronoun} may even be afraid to be away from you. To help soothe {object_pronoun} anxieties and make your partings less sorrowful, try leaving shortly after a feeding. Stick to your schedule and establish a \"goodbye\" routine to give {object_pronoun_2} a sense of security.",
    27: "You may have noticed your baby playing a new game: \"drop things on the floor.\" It may seem like a simple pastime to you (and also a source for a sore back), but {subject_pronoun} is achieving a lot with {object_pronoun} throwing. {subject_pronoun}'s learning about cause and effect. When {subject_pronoun} gets the response {subject_pronoun} expects, it reinforces {object_pronoun} understanding of how the world works.",
    28: "Let's hear some applause, please! By this week, your baby is using {object_pronoun} hands in more sophisticated ways--he may start to clap or imitate you when you wipe off {object_pronoun} food tray. {subject_pronoun} may be ready to start feeding {object_pronoun_2}self, too, so arm {object_pronoun_2} with supplies of soft finger foods (be sure they aren't choking hazards).",
    29: "{subject_pronoun}'s not ready to host dinner parties yet, but your baby is eager for some more sophisticated ways of socializing. {subject_pronoun}'s fond of peek-a-boo, and finding an object that you've hidden for {object_pronoun}. Your playtime together teaches {object_pronoun_2} the fun of sharing games--something {subject_pronoun}'ll be able to draw upon in the coming years when {subject_pronoun} meets kids at the playground.",
    30: "If {subject_pronoun} hasn't already started to crawl, your baby is busy mastering the muscular coordination and strength necessary for this feat. {object_pronoun} first attempts may be \"creeping\" (propelling {{object_pronoun_2}self on {object_pronoun} belly). Next, {subject_pronoun} may push up on {object_pronoun} hands and knees and rock. Give {object_pronoun_2} lots of time to practice and loads of encouragement. Before long, {subject_pronoun}'ll be out of the starting gates!",
    31: "Your baby's hands have likely evolved from little paws to little tools. Instead of clumsily grabbing things, {subject_pronoun}'s learning how to manipulate {object_pronoun} thumb and forefinger to pick up and hold objects. This \"pincer grasp\" will develop more in the next several weeks. Be extra vigilant about keeping choking hazards off the floor and away from {object_pronoun} curious fingers.",
    32: "So much to do, so little time could be your baby's motto this week. {object_pronoun} current preoccupation? Standing. Though {subject_pronoun}'s still young for pulling {object_pronoun_2}self up, {subject_pronoun} may be able to lean against furniture with {object_pronoun} hands free. Despite taking lots of tumbles, your baby is determined to conquer gravity. Soften {object_pronoun} falls by placing rugs or blankets under the furniture {subject_pronoun} uses as a jungle gym.",
    33: "Those days of watching your baby happily follow your command may seem far in the distant past. {subject_pronoun} has {object_pronoun} own opinions now and {subject_pronoun}'ll be sure to let you know what {subject_pronoun} does and doesn't like. Though it might be unnerving, to say the least, bear in mind that {subject_pronoun}'s experimenting with {object_pronoun} emotions and learning how to control {object_pronoun} environment.",
    34: "Over the past few weeks, your baby has developed more coordination and strength in {object_pronoun} legs and feet. {subject_pronoun} may have finally figured out how to pull {object_pronoun_2}self up to standing position. Encourage {object_pronoun_2} to stand by placing one of {object_pronoun} favorite toys on the seat of a sturdy chair. Point to the chair, tell {object_pronoun_2} the toy is there, and cheer {object_pronoun_2} on to get up and grab it.",
    35: "Stop and listen closely this week. In that gurgling brook of baby babble, you can hear the rhythms of speech! Your baby is stringing syllables together and placing different consonants with vowels. Plus, your baby understands more of what you say. {subject_pronoun} may comprehend common words like \"ball\" and \"bottle.\" Satisfy {object_pronoun} thirst for knowledge by reading {object_pronoun_2} lots of baby books and labeling things for {object_pronoun_2}. {subject_pronoun}'s taking in every word!",
    36: "At around nine months, a baby can create memories from {object_pronoun} experiences. {subject_pronoun} might look at a ball, remember how it moves, then push it. {subject_pronoun}'s even able to set goals for {object_pronoun_2}self--like making noise from a pan by crawling to it and banging it with a spoon. Give {object_pronoun_2} plastic bowls, pans, and other utensils and {subject_pronoun}'ll happily set to work while you prepare dinner.",
    37: "If you haven't already, take a good hard look around the house and put dangerous and valuable objects safely out of your baby's reach. {object_pronoun} curiosity is boundless and {object_pronoun} mobility gets {object_pronoun_2} around further and faster. Keep the bathroom door closed and tell {object_pronoun_2} that certain situations {subject_pronoun} gets into are dangerous. Your consistence and firmness will teach {object_pronoun_2} self-management skills.",
    38: "At this age, your baby leaves a trail wherever {subject_pronoun} goes. As {subject_pronoun} scoots around the house, {subject_pronoun} may pull books off shelves and clear cabinets of their contents. {subject_pronoun}'ll also happily tip over wastebaskets. Though it's tiring for you to constantly clean up after {object_pronoun_2}, {subject_pronoun} needs to be a little explorer. This inquisitiveness is a natural part of {object_pronoun} development.",
    39: "If it seems to you that your baby is always sticking something into {object_pronoun} mouth, you're probably right. Babies between the ages of eight to twelve months spend at least 20 percent of their waking hours either gumming, turning over, or banging small objects. Your little one is filled with energy and the desire to discover the whole world. Be vigilant about {object_pronoun} safety, but let {object_pronoun_2} follow {object_pronoun} bliss!",
    40: "All eyes are on you. As you go about your day doing seemingly mundane tasks, your baby is intently watching you. {subject_pronoun}'s also starting to imitate you. If given the chance, {subject_pronoun} might take a toothbrush and run it across {object_pronoun} teeth, or try combing {object_pronoun} hair. Mimicking is an important way for your baby to learn. {subject_pronoun}'ll love toys that represent real objects, like a play phone.",
    41: "You may have spent the past three nights re-reading Good Night Moon at your baby's insistence. {subject_pronoun} focuses on objects on each page and feels comforted by seeing the same images and hearing the same words over and over. Don't fight {object_pronoun} requests--this is building {object_pronoun} self-esteem. You can try slipping in a new story every once in a while.",
    42: "If you have a health club membership, you might be thinking about canceling it. Your baby is giving you plenty of exercise! {subject_pronoun}'s constantly on the go and discovering new and faster ways to move. {subject_pronoun}'s likely cruising while holding furniture and may even be making a few wobbly unassisted steps. The more time {subject_pronoun} gets to practice using {object_pronoun} legs, the stronger and more coordinated {subject_pronoun}'ll be.",
    43: "Out of sight, but not out of mind--your baby now knows that objects exist even when {subject_pronoun} can't see them. {subject_pronoun}'ll look under blankets for {object_pronoun} misplaced book, or play games by dropping a toy in a container, then turning it upside down. You can reinforce this concept of object permanence by playing a rudimentary game of hide and seek. Hide a toy under a cup and let {object_pronoun_2} find it.",
    44: "It's impossible to let your baby out of your sight. {subject_pronoun}'s discovered that there's more to {object_pronoun} world than what meets the eye on ground level. The allure of stairs and furniture is irresistible, so be sure you've installed safety gates. Though {subject_pronoun} might get {object_pronoun_2}self up, {subject_pronoun} needs help getting down. Teach {object_pronoun_2} how to descend by standing behind {object_pronoun_2} and gently pulling {object_pronoun_2} down to the closest step.",
    45: "By now, your baby is telling you, so to speak, that {subject_pronoun} wants to do things on {object_pronoun} own. {subject_pronoun} prefers feeding {object_pronoun_2}self and might even grab the spoon away from you during mealtimes. Let {object_pronoun_2}. Despite the colorful palette {subject_pronoun} drips on the tray and surrounding floor, {subject_pronoun} needs the practice to master {object_pronoun} fine motor skills. Your cheering is also helping {object_pronoun} self-image and esteem.",
    46: "Your baby's personality is really blossoming now. {subject_pronoun}'s developing {object_pronoun} opinions and isn't shy about expressing {object_pronoun} preferences for people and ways to do things. If diaper changes are becoming wrestling matches, keep in mind that {subject_pronoun}'s flexing {object_pronoun} newfound independence --a positive step in development.",
    47: "To limit accidents for your increasingly mobile baby, lay down the laws of the land. Though it's important for {object_pronoun_2} to learn by exploration, {subject_pronoun} also needs some limits and boundaries. Do this by giving {object_pronoun_2} simple directions and demonstrations: We walk to the sidewalk, then stop. Also, show {object_pronoun_2}: This is the sidewalk. And give {object_pronoun_2} a big hug and kiss each time {subject_pronoun} does what has told.",
    48: "Your baby may or may not be walking yet, but {subject_pronoun}'s certainly trying to get around. {subject_pronoun} cruises on furniture, holds your hands while taking steps, and may not even want to sit down. This is a major milestone, though babies may take that first unassisted step at anywhere from 8 to 15 months. You can help {object_pronoun} walking skills be giving {object_pronoun_2} a sturdy push-pull toy, and placing furniture in strategic areas to encourage {object_pronoun} cruising.",
    49: "There's a flip side to your baby's new-found independence. Insecurity. {subject_pronoun} realizes that by doing things on {object_pronoun} own, {subject_pronoun}'s a separate entity from you. {object_pronoun} anxiety around strangers may have returned, too. Reassure {object_pronoun_2} by staying close when {subject_pronoun} needs you, and giving {object_pronoun_2} attention when {subject_pronoun} turns to you for it.",
    50: "You may be ready to collapse at the end of the day, but your baby is too excited by {object_pronoun} new accomplishments to sleep. During {object_pronoun} last feeding, hold {object_pronoun_2} in your arms in a darkened room and gently rock {object_pronoun_2} while singing. By establishing a relaxing bedtime ritual, {subject_pronoun}'ll soon be able to expect and appreciate the break from {object_pronoun} intense day.",
    51: "Your baby is learning just how much {subject_pronoun} can handle. {subject_pronoun}'s discovered that {subject_pronoun} can hang onto an item in each hand and {subject_pronoun} can even tuck one under {object_pronoun} arm to pick up a third. You can encourage {object_pronoun} reasoning and motor skills by offering {object_pronoun_2} different tantalizing objects. Watch how {subject_pronoun} figures out how and where to hold them all!",
    52: "Happy birthday! While you're reveling in the accomplishments and changes your baby has made since entering your lives last year, {subject_pronoun} may give you a present of {object_pronoun} own: Calling {object_pronoun} parents mama or dada. {subject_pronoun}'s on the brink of using more words, too, so encourage {object_pronoun} interest in language by speaking slowly and clearly. You're preparing {object_pronoun_2} for a lifetime of learning."
